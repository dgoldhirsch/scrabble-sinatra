Directory structure and bootstrapping of app came from:

    http://blog.chrisblunt.com/lightweight-web-apps-getting-started-with-sinatra/
    
Some of the settings in this didn't work, including a mistakenly escaped bit of Ruby code in app.rb.
Also, config.ru needs a leading './' when 'requiring' app.rb.
